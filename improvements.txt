find diagonal algorithm
comment 'winner' methods

---------------------

tests:

test all error handling

CAN'T BREAk print

don't allow inputs inside functions
make them their own functions, then embed functions and during
testing we can pass in manual variables.

-------------------------

add an option to abort at any time by entering draw, making both players agree







have a match class, which could have a tournament subclass
the match class could take in player names and store the games-won tally

better way to do diagonal checker? can these be classes?
i want to pass a + or - in as an agrument since the NE and NW diagonal functions
only differ by a sign. is that possible without defining my own funciton
